# My App Status - iOS App

This is an iOS client for the web service, [My App Status](http://myappstat.us), which makes it easy to see the state of your Mac and iOS app store status’s (In review, waiting for review, etc).

I tried to get this app into the iOS App Store so it could receive push notifications and stuff, but it was rejected. Apple didn’t like that the web service parses their emails. Fair enough. So now I’m open sourcing it so those that want to, can build & install it for themselves. 

The app isn’t 100% polished, but it does what I want. Namely, lets me see how long ago I submitted an app. For push notifications I’m happy to use [Pushover](http://pushover.net) setup via the web interface to [My App Status](http://myappstat.us).

This is a universal app and requires iOS 5.

Enjoy!
